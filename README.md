ImpCA-Lexical-Analyser
======================

This was for a javacc assignment. 
We were to parse a simple example programming language into tokens using javacc.

This is the code generated by running 'javacc ImpCA_Lex.jj'


To run this code use 'javac ImpCA_Lex.java'
then run with 'java ImpCA_Lex example.imp'
