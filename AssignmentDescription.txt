Design a Lexical Analyser for the ImpCA language.
------------------------------------------------

I have separated out the various components of my
Lexical Analyser. Within the ImpCA_Lex.jj file I 
outline how I tackled the various Token Regular 
Expressions. These are all kept in homogeneous
bunches. 
(re. Numbers / Strings / Keywords / Identifiers
and Symbols)

I will give a brief outline of the above here.

SKIP:
All spaces, newline characters, tabs and return
characters are skipped. I assigned a token for 
space to be used later in the STRING token
definition as I need to allow spaces in my strings.

TOKENS:
These will be parsed by our token parser and printed
out in any easy to understand pattern.

Keywords - I parsed the listed keywords in the 
assignment specification. I also allowed TRUE and
FALSE to instead be represented by the BOOLEAN
Identifier. In parsing the keywords I made
the assumption that the keywords themselves 
would perform to definition.
(re. 'and' keyword would parse to the token <AND>, 
instead of equivalent boolean '&&' in java for example)

Symbols - Next I parsed the operator symbols and
other keyboard symbols. The majority of these symbols
would only be used in String definitions. I think
I've accounted for every symbol on my keyboard.

Numbers - This should parse all numbers, real numbers
and negative numbers. I added the negative numbers after
realizing I left them out when testing. The only tricky thing
here was getting the real number specified properly.
The trick lied in the difference between + and * when it
comes to regular expressions.

Strings - This parses all Strings in the ImpCA language
that start and end with double-quotes. I have accounted for
all symbols, spaces and the need for escaping the following 
\\ , \n, \"

Identifiers - This parses words that begin with a char
and contain any combination of chars,digits and underscores 
afterwords. I also print the image of the token on output.
